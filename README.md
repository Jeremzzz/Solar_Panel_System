  Our project is a system for taking informations on a garden thanks to nodes which are connected to a gateway where informations of temperature and pression will be sended. The gateway will after send data on the web thanks to WIFI and will be plotted on a website like Thingspeak or NodeRed.
  Firstly, we will use a solar lamp for our node part. We will add an Arduino mini pro with DHT22 to take pressure and temperature information
